# 🧮 My First Calculator
## 📘 Description

This project is a learning exercise built in Python to practice fundamental programming concepts.
It’s a simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations between two numeric values.

Future versions will expand the logic to support operations with multiple values (n numbers) and include more advanced mathematical features.

### ⚙️ Features

* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and power.

* Input validation for incorrect values or division by zero.

* A simple text-based menu built using match case (Python 3.10+).

### 🧠 Skills Reinforced

* This project helps strengthen several core programming skills:

* Python syntax and control structures (while, try/except, match case)

* Function design and modular programming

* Input validation and exception handling

* Basic logic and arithmetic operations

* User interaction via console

### 🚀 Future Improvements

* Extend calculator functionality to handle n-value operations

* Add looped input for continuous calculations

* Implement error-free menus with data validation in every stage

* Possibly include unit tests for each function

### 🛠️ Requirements

* Python 3.10 or higher (for match statement compatibility)

Run the program with:
```
python calculator.py
```
